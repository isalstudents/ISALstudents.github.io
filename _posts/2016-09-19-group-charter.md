# International Society for the study of Artificial Life - Student Group
{{page.date | date_to_string}}

#### Mission Statement

The purpose of the ISAL student group is to provide opportunities for students
and post-docs interested in artificial life to interact with each other, develop
professionally, and contribute to the broader artificial life community.

#### Group Structure

The ISAL Student Group will be organized via
a [Slack group](https://isalstudents.slack.com). All members of the Slack group
are members of the student group. We are a relatively non-hierarchical group,
with interested members self-organizing around activities that they are
interested in. However, there are a few formally elected roles in place to
ensure that the organization remains stable and functional:

+ Chair: This person is responsible for keeping the group on track, ensuring
  decisions get made when necessary, resolving conflicts, and instigating
  activities and events when necessary.
+ ISAL Board representative: This person is responsible for attending ISAL board
  meetings, communicating between the board and the student group, and writing
  summaries of ISAL meetings.
+ Treasurer: This person is responsible for handling all funds the student group
  receives.
+ Vice chair: Takes over the duties of the chair when that person is temporarily
  unavailable
+ Communications chair: Default contact person for the group, manages social
  media accounts.
+ Secretary: In charge of taking notes at chair meetings.

#### Election Process

Members interested in filling one of the above positions should self-nominate.
Any other member may then second this self-nomination. If there are multiple
seconded nominations for a position, a vote will be held. All members of the
student group will have one week to cast an anonymous vote for each position.
The people receiving the most votes for each position will fill that position.
All positions are elected for a term of 1 year. Terms start in October, at the
same time as ISAL board positions.

#### Code of Conduct

The ISAL Student Group is a community organization. We value the involvement of
everyone in this community, and are committed to creating a friendly and
respectful place for exchanging ideas. All participants in our events and
communications are expected to show respect and courtesy to others. To make
clear what is expected, everyone participating in ISAL Student Group activities
is required to conform to the following Code of Conduct. This code of conduct
applies to all spaces managed by the ISAL Student Group including, but not
limited to, email lists, online forums, and in person events.
 
If you believe someone is violating the Code of Conduct we ask that you report
it to one of the two designated chairs (currently Emily Dolson and Iñaki
Fernández Pérez). All reports will be kept confidential. If you believe anyone
is in immediate physical danger, please contact appropriate law enforcement
first. If this violation took place at a conference, note that ISAL has a
conference anti-harassment policy similar to this one. Per that policy, there
should also be designated people associated with the conference who you can
contact instead of or in addition to student group chairs.
 
The ISAL Student Group is dedicated to providing a welcoming and supportive
environment for all people, regardless of factors such as gender identity,
gender expression, transgender status, sexual orientation, disability, physical
appearance, body size, race, nationality, sex, colour, ethnic or social origin,
pregnancy, citizenship, familial status, veteran status, genetic information,
religion or belief, political or any other opinion, membership of a national
minority, property, birth, age, or choice of text editor. We do not tolerate
harassment of participants on the basis of these categories, or for any other
reason.
 
Harassment is any form of behaviour intended to exclude, intimidate, or cause
discomfort. Because we are a diverse community, we may have different ways of
communicating and of understanding the intent behind actions. Therefore we have
chosen to prohibit certain forms of behaviour in our community, regardless of
intent. Prohibited harassing behaviour includes but is not limited to:

+ written or verbal comments which have the effect of excluding people on the basis of membership of a specific group listed above
+ causing someone to fear for their safety, such as through stalking, following, or intimidation
+ the display of sexual or violent images
+ unwelcome sexual attention
+ nonconsensual or unwelcome physical contact
+ sustained disruption of talks, events or communications
+ incitement to violence, suicide, or self-harm
+ continuing to initiate interaction (including photography or recording) with someone after being asked to stop
+ publication of private communication without consent
 
Behaviour not explicitly mentioned above may still constitute harassment. The
list above should not be taken as exhaustive but rather as a guide to make it
easier to enrich all of us and the communities in which we participate. All
interactions should be professional regardless of location: harassment is
prohibited whether it occurs on- or offline, and the same standards apply to
both. If a group member engages in harassing behaviour, the chairs of the group
may take any action they deem appropriate, ranging from warning the offender to
expulsion from the group. Enforcement of the Code of Conduct will be respectful
and not include any harassing behaviors. Thank you for helping make this a
welcoming, friendly community for all.
 
The two chairs designated as people to contact in case of Code of Conduct
violations will be chosen from among the set of chairs through discussion and
consensus. The chairs selected should not have any obvious conflicts of interest
with each other, to ensure that there is someone to go to in the event that one
of them violates the Code of Conduct.
 
This code of conduct is a modified version of that used by Software Carpentry,
which was based off of the policy used by PyCon, which in turn is forked from a
template written by the Ada Initiative and hosted on the Geek Feminism Wiki. It
also includes portions from the ISAL Conference Anti-Harassment policy, which
was also derived from the template written by the Ada Initiative.
