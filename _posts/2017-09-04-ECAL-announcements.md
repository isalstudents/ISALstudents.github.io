### ECAL 2017

We hosted events at [ECAL 2017](https://project.inria.fr/ecal2017/).

#### Senior-Junior lunches

To give students a chance to interact with faculty doing research they find
interesting in a low pressure setting, we organized lunch-time networking.
Students were matched with seniors in the field in groups of 2-3 per senior.

#### Social Event

We went out for
[dinner and drinks](https://twitter.com/ISALstudents/status/905870085780381696)
as a group one night during ECAL.

#### Student Meeting

We held the first in-person general meeting of the ISAL Student Group during a
Friday session of ECAL. Beyond discussing the group and board nominations,
students gave 5 minute flash talks on a variety of topic.
