#### Exploring hypotheticals of real and artificial life

The ISAL student group is starting a discussion series where we’ll take
different crazy hypotheticals and explore them seriously. Discussion will happen
informally in a dedicated Slack channel for one month following the question
posting, and then will be edited by the board for brevity and formatting. The
formatted discussions will be posted on the ISAL student group website and
potentially in the ISAL journal. Example questions include:

+ How would life be different if there were no moon?
+ How would life evolve on a rogue planet with water?
+ What if reproductive cycles were universally twice as fast?
+ Does coffee speed up time?
+ What if time were variable over small areas?

While we’re not looking to answer these questions by any means, approaching them
from an artificial life mindset could be both an enjoyable exercise for us and a
good way for others to understand our field a bit. A similar series is
XKCD’s [“What if”](https://what-if.xkcd.com/), although this usually approaches
questions with physics. An example of the Slack chat format is the political
website [538’s chat series](https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/slack-chat/).
