*[NAWKI](/2017/08/20/nawki-announcement.html) (life, but Not As We Know It), is
a monthly series exploring the hypotheticals of real and artificial life*

------------------------

**Emily Dolson**: The question for October is *"How would life be different if
there were no moon?"*

**Tim Atkinson:** I dug out a
[New Scientist article](https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn4786-no-moon-no-life-on-earth-suggests-theory/) I
read like 14 years ago which seemed relevant.

I must have been 10 and my mum started me on NS early haha

Seems pretty influential

**Iñaki Fernández Pérez**: Without having read that article, here is my small
contribution to the question: no moon means 1) no sea and ocean tides, 2)
asteroids that collided with the moon would have collided with the earth
instead, 3) the regulation process that the moon exerts on the orbit of the
earth would not exist

I guess that we should clarify if the question refers to: 1) the moon never
existed, or 2) the moon suddenly disappears once life already developed

both seem interesting

**d9w**: Thanks for the article, **@Tim Atkinson**. If I can summarize: the
strong tides from the early moon could have provided a good environment for DNA
formation due to high variability in coastal salinity. High tide meant low
salinity and breaking double-stranded molecules, low tide meant higher salinity
and more molecular formation, and this cycle could have led to molecular strands
like DNA forming

Without opening the entire early Earth chemistry issue, though, I wouldn't take
this to mean that no moon = no life. There have been a number of ways proposed
for RNA formation that could do without tidal forces

Not to mention panspermia (although I think we should mention panspermia :P)

The effect of tidal forces on life formation is definitely worth considering
though. In the event that DNA or even RNA did come around, I would imagine that
a lack of tidal forces on coastlines would make life gathering in those places
much less rare, slowing down aquatic evolution

**Tim Atkinson**: Ay, I'm not suggesting that definitely no moon = no life, just
that its a possible extreme interpretation of there being no moon


**d9w**: Yup. I definitely think no moon = harder life

**Tim Atkinson**: I can't find a source but I also remember somewhere claiming
that tides were important for the development of land based life

aquatic life in tidal regions can be exposed to the air for a few hours before
being submerged again which allows an incremental development

but again, I can't find the source or offer more detail

**d9w**: **@Iñaki Fernández Pérez**, I'd say the question is "without a moon at
X point." So even if the moon is necessary for early molecular mixing, what if
there were no moon once life got started?

also i'll point out that when we're discussing tides, the sun has a
slight [tidal effect](http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/tide.html) that
we shouldn't ignore.

**Tim Atkinson**: yeah if you take it to mean "the moon never existed", and if
you buy into the giant impact hypothesis then no moon, no collision between
early Earth and "Theia", so the Earth's outer layers never vaporised and we're
pretty much in a different timeline at that point

good point :simple_smile:

**Emily Dolson**: This is making me realize that I know surprisingly little
about the role of intertidal creatures in the transition to living on land. That
argument completely makes sense - it would set up a nice evolutionary gradient
where progressively more resistance to being out of the water was always
advantageous. But I feel like everything I've ever learned about the transition
to land is about the fin-limb transition.
And [Tiktaalik](http://tiktaalik.uchicago.edu/meetTik.html) doesn't exactly seem
like a tide-pool creature.

The hypothesis I've heard about Tiktaalik is that it lived mostly in shallow
water, but its limb-like fins allowed it to occasionally venture out on land. So
I guess that sort of uses behavior to create the same evolutionary gradient
(i.e. any additional ability to survive out of the water is selectively
advantageous) that tides might. Which would be an argument that we could still
have life without the moon.

Is [this](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/moon-life-tides/)
the article you were thinking of, **@Tim Atkinson?**

Oh, oops, look at me and my tetrapod-centric worldview. Arthropods were
the
[first animals on land](http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2002/05/tracks-found-earliest-steps-land).
But the same argument about behavior applies.

**d9w**: Agreed on the evolutionary gradient based on strong tides. The transition
to land seems like one of the big emergent changes in evolutionary history
(type-2 novelty
in
[Banzhaf et al. "Defining and simulating open-ended novelty: requirements, guidelines, and challenges."](http://web.cs.mun.ca/~banzhaf/papers/OEE_2016.pdf) terms,
I think)

Having tides would mean a greater chance for land exposure without developing
any behavior that gets you on land; the water would do that alone. Similarly to
how DNA formation could have profited from "[throwing] water up on a hot rock,
then have the waters recede and evaporate," certain organisms might have
displayed exaptation once they were also thrown up on some hot rocks

I didn't realize this until today, but this question is very seasonal for
Halloween :simple_smile: That would certainly be different if there
were no moon

Seems like intertidal areas were certainly important for
[bacterial migration](https://ecologicalprocesses.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/2192-1709-2-1)
to land, which makes sense.

The author here mentions estuaries, though, and that's a good point: there are
some places where water is going to move up and down coastlines without tides.
So, again, for this part of evolution, it seems like the moon helped quite a bit
by making tides, but it wasn't the only means for a transition to land.

I'd like to ask about non-tidal impact of the moon, though. **@Iñaki Fernández
Pérez** brought up more asteroids and the changes to the earth's orbit. I'll
posit that a lot of life has used moonlight for sensing. Would the eye have
evolved as many times as it did if nights were always dark? Would we see more
bio-luminescence?

**Emily Dolson**: Oh, yeah, good point about bacteria. I was trying to think about
early mosses, but was similarly having a hard time figuring out if they actually
first evolved in places where there were tides, vs. in rivers.

I feel like I should know the answer to this, but without the moon how dark
would the night be? For instance, without human-generated light, can cats see
anything during new moon? I would assume they can, but now I'm doubting myself.

Or were you more thinking of sensing in terms of the way moths use the moon to
determine which way is up?

I guess a very minor side effect of having no moon is that we wouldn't have to
deal with moths flying into our lights and dieing :simple_smile:. Of
course, that's predicated on us still existing and having lights.

**pennyfaulkner**: I'm interested in the impact of the moon on human development
and time. An hour is a division of the day into 12 or 24 blocks depending on how
you measure, this is a number we don't generally see used as a divisor otherwise
though. However high tide changes by about an hour a day. Months and weeks can
both be traced back to origins based on lunar calendars. How would we measure
time without the moon? With out a strong and reliable way to measure time at
several levels can civilization progress as far as it has?

For reference
even [plankton](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.2307/1939811/full) react
to lunar cycles to define rhythmic behaviours.
 
**Emily Dolson**: That's a really interesting point. Without a moon, it would be
possible to perceive daily cycles and yearly cycles, but not monthly cycles. I
wonder if we'd see calendars that used seasons in place of months?

**d9w**: according to the giant impact theory, the Earth's axial tilt is a result
of the Moon's formation, so we might not have had seasons either. But if our
solar system is any indicator for the general case, axial tilts seem pretty
variable, so I think we could count on a hypothetical no-Moon Earth to have some
seasons.

I've also seen that 12 was a common divisor because of its number of factors, so
early economic systems favored it, hence dozens and grosses. Hours don't seem to
apply there, though, at least in modern perception; people don't think about 6
hours as a unit like a half-dozen.
