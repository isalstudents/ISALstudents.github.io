### ALIFE 2018

We will be hosting events throughout the week at ALIFE 2018. We'll also be
covering the event on Twitter, under #alife2018.

#### Student Meeting

*July 24, 12:30 - 13:00, Venus & Mars*

We will talk about the ISAL student group, our current activities, and
possibilities for students during the lunch block on Tuesday. Students are
encouraged to get their lunch from 12:00 - 12:30 and then to join us in Venus &
Mars.

#### ISAL Outstanding Student Research Award

*July 24, 13:00 - 13:30, Venus & Mars*

As part of the student meeting on Tuesday, the winner of the ISAL Outstanding
Student Research Award will present their work:

"Referential communication as a collective property of a
brain-body-environment-body-brain system," presented by Jorge Campos

#### Social Event

Tuesday night, we'll be going out as a student group. We'll first meet near the
cruise departure point at 7 so any students who are going on the cruise can join
us then. Afterwards, we'll head to a restaurant to hang out together!
