# {{ page.title }}

The [ISAL](http://alife.org/) student group is an international and
interdisciplinary collection of students and post-docs interested in artificial
life. The group was founded in September, 2016, following discussions at
the [ALIFE 2016](http://alife2016.alife.org/) conference. Since then, the group
has been meeting online to discuss ALife articles, share projects and job
offers, and connect with each other. Follow the group here or
on [witter](https://twitter.com/ISALstudents) for updates.


#### Conferences

We have organized [events](2017/09/04/ECAL-announcements.html) at
the
[2017 European Conference on Artificial Life](https://project.inria.fr/ecal2017/) and
will be organizing similar events at
the [2018 ALIFE]( http://alife2018.alife.cs.is.nagoya-u.ac.jp/) conference.


#### Life, but not as we know it (NAWKI)

Every month, we explore a hypothetical of real and artificial life. Further
information [here](/2017/08/20/nawki-announcement.html).

#### Journal club

We meet usually once every two weeks to discuss an artificial life article for
an hour. One member of the group prepares an overview of the article, which is
followed by discussion.

#### ISAL award for Outstanding Student Research

We will be awarding a student paper award as part of the 2018 ISAL awards. Any
published works by student members can be considered for nomination. Further
details of the voting process and timeline will be posted in Slack.
